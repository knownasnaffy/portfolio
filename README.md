# My first portfolio website

This is one of the first projects I created after learning tailwindcss.

## Start locally

1. Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/knownasnaffy/portfolio
cd portfolio
```

2. Install dependencies and approve builds

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm approve-builds # If using the latest version of pnpm which requires this
```

3. Start the dev server

```sh
pnpm dev
```

After this command, you can enter `o` in the terminal and press enter to automatically open the localhost url the website was hosted on.
